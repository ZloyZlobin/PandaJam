Panda Jam Test

Don't worry about graphics (boxes in different colours would be completely acceptable). 
This is only about coding and architectural choices.

We'd like you to create a simple prototype of a game like Panda Jam (on Facebook)

Basically it's like Diamond Dash, but rows get added from the bottom (by the mean monkey guy) and you have to rescue little animals from the top by clearing all blocks below them.

I'd ask you to make a simple version with maybe up to 3 predesigned levels (or a random level generator) and include 3 of the following extra features:
- bombs (destroy a bunch of blocks)
- firework (destroy a column)
- turn (rotate an area of 9 blocks clockwise)
- ice (needs to be destroyed 2x)
- anything else you fancy
